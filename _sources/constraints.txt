Using Mathematical Constraints
=================================

While being able to fix variables and place upper and lower bounds on their
values are key parts of LMFIT, an equally important feature is the ability
to place mathematical constraints on parameters.  This section describes
how to do this, and what sort of parameterizations are possible.
